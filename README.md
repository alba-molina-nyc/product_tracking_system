# Production Tracking System

## Job Creation Form:
In this form or page, we should be able to enter information in to the following fields
- Order number
- SKU
- Number of items
- Number of stones
- Job description
- Setter name (Setter A, Setter B, Setter C)
## Please note that time is very valuable for us, therefore in our current system we do not close the form instead we clear the fields after every submission. This way we do not need to keep re-opening the form for every job entry.
Jobs Page:
This page should show the entries of jobs with the following columns
- Order number
- SKU
- Number of items
- Number of stones
- Job description
- Setter name (Setter A, Setter B, Setter C)
- Name of the person created the job (Person A, Person B, Person C)
- Job creation date
- Name of the person assigned the jobs and printed the memo
- Memo number
We shall be able to filter on this result page by the the following fields at minimum, it would be better if we can filter on all fields.
- Order number
- SKU
- Setter name (the most important field we need to be able to filter on)
- Job creation date
Once we filter and get the expected results, then we shall be able to choose multiple rows or all the rows and assign to a setter (Setter A, Setter B, Setter C) to create a memo.
We need to calculate the Total Amount by multiplying the total number of stones by $0.50. What would be the amount we need to pay to the setter.
This memo should be in printable format, and we shold be able to pull previous memos and reprint when needed.
